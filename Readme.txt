A Comparative Study of Recommendation System Techniques. A Hybrid Recommendation System for a Music Platform.


The Goal of the Project: to Evaluate Types of Recommendation Systems and Build a Hybrid Recommendation System to provide personalized, relevant recommendations for a Music Platform. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and evaluation of 5 potential approaches: Popularity-Based, Cosine Similarity User-User Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (Singular Value Decomposition SVD), Clustering, Content-Based Filtering. Evaluation metrics: MAP@K (Mean Average Precision for K Recommendations), MAR@K (Mean Average Recall for K Recommendations).

Skills and Tools

Rank Based Recommendation Systems, Similarity Based Recommendation System, Matrix Factorization Based Recommendation System, Clustering Based Recommendation System, Content Based Recommendation System

Conclusion

A Hybrid approach is proposed. It combines three methods: Content-Based Filtering on Observed Item Features with TF-IDF keywords extraction technique (NLP, Natural Language Processing), Singular Value Decomposition Collaborative Filtering, and Popularity-based Method for New Users. Implementation is done in Python. The proposed Hybrid model handles Cold Start Problem, increases Engagement and Discoverability.
